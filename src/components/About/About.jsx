          I have honed my skills over the past two years while studying at
          Noroff, where I developed a strong foundation in creating visually
          appealing and user-friendly websites. My expertise includes HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and various modern frameworks and tools. I am dedicated to
          crafting seamless digital experiences that not only meet client needs
          but also delight users. Let's build something great together!
